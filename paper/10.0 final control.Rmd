abstract: Insurance serves both as a source of loss reimbursement and contingent capital.
  The expected value of claims (i.e., loss reimbursement value) for the insured in
  high excess layers is minimal, so the principal value of insurance in those layers  is
  as a source of contingent capital. This paper describes an approach to measure this
  source of value.
