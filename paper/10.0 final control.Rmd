abstract: "Insurance serves as a source of both loss reimbursement and contingent capital. The expected value of claims (i.e., loss reimbursement value) for the insured in high-excess layers is minimal, so the principal value of insurance in those layers is as a source of contingent capital. This paper describes an approach to measure this source of value."
