abstract: "Insurance serves both as a source of loss reimbursment and contingent capital. The expected value of claims (i.e., loss reimburement value) for the insured in high excess layers is minimal so the principal value of high exces layer insurance is as a source of contingent capital. This paper describes an approach to measure this source of value."
