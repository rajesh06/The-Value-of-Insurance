# Introduction

Commercial insurance programs are often depicted as "towers." (See Figure \ref{fig:tower}) Extending this analogy, the lowest floors of the tower are typically comprised of risk retained by the insured. The middle floors include commercially insured working layers.  High excess layer insurance resides in the penthouse. 

Each of these layers has a cost to it. Insurers establish premiums which are sufficient to cover claim costs, expenses and a profit provision. The profit provision will be proportional to the volatility of the risk. That is, supporting insurer capital is directly proportional to the volatility of the business. As a result, more volatile business will require additional (absolute) profit that the insurer must return to its shareholder. In describing the cost for various insurance layers, we ignore expenses and refer to the profit provision as a capital charge. 

*   The cost of the lowest layers will have a reasonable degree of predictability. The cost for these layers will principally be the expected loss with a minimal capital charge for volatility. There may also be frictional costs associated with risk retention such as increased audit and actuarial fees and claims costs from legal counsel and third party claim administrators.

*   The middle layers provide coverage for claims related to events that occur with a degree of regularity. The amount of claims may not be reasonably predictable in a single year but would be predictable over a longer-term time horizon. They insurance coverage provides value to the insured by smoothing claim volatility \emph{over time}. There may be multiple insurers in the higher working layers.

*   Insureds generally do not expect to access coverage from the highest layers. The expected claims will likely be close to \$0. The variance of claims in this layer however may be significant.  Insurance in this layer smooths claims volatility \emph{over risks and time}. As a result of the need to smooth volatility across risks, there are often multiple insurers in these layers, each with a pro-rata share. These high excess layers are the focus of this paper.

## The Value of High Excess Layers

Despite insureds not expected to access higher layers as expected claim amounts are minimal, premiums in these layers can be significant. At times buyers refer to these layers as "sleep insurance"; that is the insurance allows the buyer to sleep at night. In this paper, we explore approach that the buyer can consider to understand whether there is *financial value* ^[That is, the value beyond the restful night of sleep.] to the insurance transaction. Measuring this value provides the insured a basis upon which to assess the premium established by the insurer.

To assess the value, we should understand that the primary benefit of this layer is not in the expected loss but the protection of capital that this layer of insurance provides to the insured. Indeed, in this layer, insureds often consider the insurance as part of its capital structure rather than as an operational cost. Beyond this protection of capital, insurance will also reduce earning volatility and potentially improve the attractiveness of the firm to investors. In this paper, we review these benefits of insurance.

## Literature Search

Most research related to capital in the insurance transaction focuses on the \emph{insurer's} return on capital rather than the protection of the \emph{insured's} capital. The limited research related to the insured's preference focuses on utility theory (as a function of wealth) and that research is generally presented in the context of personal insurance coverages (such as homeowners). Capital protection and wealth maximization are related concepts and utility functions (generically) provide a basis to assess alternatives. This is not dissimilar to the approach that we present in this paper.

* Utility functions are typically abstract whereas the measurement approach we present in this paper is more specifically defined. 

* We frame our approach in the context of commercial insurance and present two value considerations for a commercial insured. 

We provide the papers that we reviewed in Appendix \ref{literature-review},

## Measuring Value

In this paper we now consider the two primary sources of value for the insured:

-   The ability to deploy capital that it would have otherwise had to set aside for an insurable event. We present our review of this source of value in Section \ref{capital-deployment}.

- Reduced volatility of earnings and the resulting reduction in required     return. We present our review of this source of value in Section \ref{risk-adjustment-to-required-return}.
