# Risk Premium Rate

The second source of value created by insurance results from the reduction in
the volatility of returns for insurance buyers. Investors will demand a lower
return from firms with reduced earning volatility.

As we did in measuring the value through capital deployment, we first calculate
the Sharpe Ratio without insurance (i.e., the base case) and then compare to the Sharpe Ratio for the insurance buyer. In this analysis, we focus on the change in Sharpe Ratio.

$$
\text{Sharpe Ratio} = \frac{E(R)-r_f}{\sigma_{R}}
$$

The Sharpe Ratio relates the risk premium required (numerator) to return
volatility (denominator). More specifically, the Sharpe Ratio indicates the risk premium required for every unit of volatility.

## Sharpe Ratio without insurance

As with the discussion in Section \ref{capital-deployment}, we use the naught subscript to represent the base case. We can calculate $E(R_0)$, $var(R_0)$ as presented below under the assumption that the risk free rate, $r_f$, is fixed and that that $X$ and $r_c$ are independent.

$$
\begin{aligned}
E(R_{0}) &= E(\dfrac{r_c \times CW_{0} + r_f \times CX_{0} - X}{C})\\
&=\frac{CW_{0}\times E(r_c)}{C} -\frac{E(X)}{C} +\frac{r_f \times CX_{0}}{C}\\
&=\frac{CW_{0}\times E(r_c)}{C} +\frac{r_f \times CX_{0}}{C}\\
&=\frac{(C-CX_{0})\times E(r_c)}{C} +\frac{r_f \times CX_{0}}{C}\\
\\
var(R_{0}) &= var(\dfrac{r_c \times CW_{0} + r_f \times CX_{0} - X}{C})\\
&=\frac{CW_{0}^2\times var(r_c)}{C^2} +\frac{var(X)}{C^2}-\frac{2 \times CW_{0} \times cov(X,r_c)}{C^2} \\
&=\frac{(C-CX_{0})^2\times var(r_c)}{C^2} +\frac{var(X)}{C^2}
\end{aligned}
$$

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{Sharpe Ratio}_0 &=\frac{E(R_0)-r_f}{\sigma_{R_0}}\\
&=\frac{(C-CX_{0})\times E(r_c)+r_f \times CX_{0}-r_f \times C}{C} / (\frac{(C-CX_{0})^2\times var(r_c)+var(x)}{C^2})^{0.5}\\
&=\frac{(C-CX_{0})\times (E(r_c)-r_f)}{((C-CX_{0})^2\times var(r_c)+var(x))^{0.5}}\\
\end{aligned}
$$

## Sharpe Ratio With Insurance

We can also calculate the Sharpe Ratio for the insurance buyer, using the subsript I to represent this case. We calculate $E(r_I)$ and $var(r_I)$ 

$$
\begin{aligned}
E(R_{I}) &= E(\dfrac{r_c \times (CW_{I} - P) + r_f \times CX_{I} - X_{ret} - P}{C})\\
&=\frac{(CW_{I} - P)\times E(r_c)}{C} -\frac{E(X_{ret})}{C} +\frac{r_f \times CX_{I}-P}{C}\\
&=\frac{(CW_{I} - P)\times E(r_c))}{C} +\frac{r_f \times CX_{I}-P}{C}\\
&=\frac{(C - P)\times E(r_c))-P}{C}\\
\\
var(R_{I}) &= var(\dfrac{r_c \times (CW_{I} - P) + r_f \times CX_{I} - X_{ret} - P}{C})\\
&=\frac{(CW_{I} - P)^2\times var(r_c)}{C^2} +\frac{var(X_{ret})}{C^2}-\frac{2 \times (CW_{I} - P) \times cov(X_{ret},r_c)}{C^2} \\
&=\frac{(C - P)^2\times var(r_c)}{C^2} +\frac{var(X_{ret})}{C^2}
\end{aligned}
$$ 

Now we calculate the Sharpe Ratio under the insurance case:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{Sharpe Ratio}_I &= \frac{E(R_I)-r_f}{\sigma_{R_0}}\\
&=\frac{(C - P)\times E(r_c))-P-C \times rf}{C}\ / (\frac{(C-P)^2\times var(r_c)+var(X_{ret})}{C^2})^{0.5}\\
&=\frac{C\times (E(r_c)-r_f)-P \times(1+E(r_c))}{((C-P)^2\times var(r_c)+var(X_{ret}))^{0.5}}\\
\end{aligned}
$$ 

Finally, we can simplify and compare these 2 Sharpe Ratio. I haven't gone
through strict calculation yet, but via simple comparison, we can find that with the increase of var(x), the 'with insurance' Sharpe Ratio will decrease more slowly than 'without insurance', which shows the value of insurance.

P.S. When we compare the expected returns of 2 cases, the result would be
exactly the same as the result in Value Creation Section. So I didn't attach it
one more time.
