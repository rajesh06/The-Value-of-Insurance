# Risk Adjustment to Required Return

The second source of value created by insurance results from the reduction in the volatility of returns for insurance buyers. The value creation results form the lower required return for firms with reduced earning volatility. 

The Sharpe Ratio relates the risk premium required (numerator) to return volatility (denominator). More specifically, the Sharpe Ratio indicates the risk premium required for every unit of volatility. As we did in measuring the value through capital deployment, we first calculate the Sharpe Ratio without insurance (i.e., the base case) and then compare to the Sharpe Ratio for the insurance buyer. In this analysis, we focus on the change in Sharpe Ratio.

$$
\text{Sharpe Ratio} = \frac{E(R)-r_f}{\sigma_{R}}
$$

## Sharpe Ratio without insurance

As with the discussion in Section \@ref{capital-deployment}, we use the naught subscript to represent the base case. 

We can calculate $E(R_0)$, $Var(R_0)$ as presented below under the following assumptions:
  
* The risk free rate, $r_f$, is fixed and    
* $X$ and $r_c$ are independent.

Starting with the equation from Section 2.1:
  
$$
\begin{aligned}
E[R_{0}] &= E[\dfrac{r_c \times CW_{0} + r_f \times C_{X}^{0}}{C}]\\
&=\dfrac{CW_{0}\times r_c}{C} + \dfrac{r_f \times C_{X}^{0}}{C}\\
&=\frac{(C-C_{X}^{0})\times r_c}{C} +\frac{r_f \times C_{X}^{0}}{C}\\
\\
Var[R_{0}] &= Var[\dfrac{r_c \times CW_{0} + r_f \times C_{X}^{0} - X}{C})\\
&=\dfrac{Var(X)}{C^2}
\end{aligned}
$$

\begin{align}
\nonumber \text{Sharpe Ratio}_0 &=\frac{E(R_0)-r_f}{\sigma_{R_0}}\\
\nonumber &=\frac{(C-C_{X}^{0})\times r_c + r_f \times C_{X}^{0}-r_f \times C}{C} / (\frac{Var(X)}{C^2})^{0.5}\\
\nonumber  &=\frac{(C-C_{X}^{0})\times (r_c-r_f)}{SD(X)}\\
\end{align}

## Sharpe Ratio With Insurance

We can also calculate the Sharpe Ratio for the insurance buyer, using the subscript $I$ to represent this case and starting with the equation from Section 2.2:
$$
\begin{aligned}
E[R_{I}] &= E[\dfrac{r_c \times (C - P^{I}) - P^{I}}{C}]\\
Var[R_{I}] &= Var(\dfrac{r_c \times (C - P^{I}) + r_f \times C_{X}^{I} - X_{ret} - P^{I}}{C})\\
Var[R_{I}] &=\dfrac{Var(X_{ret})}{C^2}
\end{aligned}
$$ 
  
Now we calculate the Sharpe Ratio under the insurance case:

\begin{align}
\nonumber \text{Sharpe Ratio}_I &= \dfrac{E(R_I)-r_f}{\sigma_{R_0}}\\
\nonumber &=\dfrac{(C - P^{I}) \times r_c-P^{I} - C \times r_f}{C} / (\dfrac{Var(X_{ret})}{C^2})^{0.5}\\
&=\dfrac{C\times (r_c-r_f)-P^{I} \times(1 + r_c)}{SD(X_{ret})}
\end{align}

## Value Creation
The insurance purchase created value when it results in an increase in the Sharpe Ratio. 

\begin{align}
\nonumber \text{Sharpe Ratio}_I &> \text{Sharpe Ratio}_0\\
\nonumber \dfrac{C\times (r_c-r_f)-P^{I} \times(1 + r_c)}{SD(X_{ret})} &> \dfrac{(C-C_{X}^{0})\times (r_c-r_f)}{SD(X)}\\
\nonumber C\times (r_c-r_f)-P^{I} \times(1 + r_c) &> \dfrac{SD(X_{ret})}{SD(X)} \times (C-C_{X}^{0})\times (r_c-r_f)\\
\nonumber -P^{I} \times(1 + r_c) &> \dfrac{SD(X_{ret})}{SD(X)}\times (C-C_{X}^{0}) \times (r_c-r_f)- C \times (r_c-r_f)\\
\nonumber -P^{I} \times(1 + r_c) &> (r_c-r_f) \times [\dfrac{SD(X_{ret})}{SD(X)}\times (C-C_{X}^{0}) - C]\\ 
\nonumber P^{I} &< \dfrac{(r_c-r_f)}{(1 + r_c)} \times [\dfrac{SD(X_{ret})}{SD(X)}\times (C_{X}^{0}- C) + C]\\ 
\nonumber P^{I} &< \dfrac{(r_c-r_f)}{(1 + r_c)} \times [\dfrac{SD(X_{ret})}{SD(X)}\times C_{X}^{0} - \dfrac{SD(X_{ret})}{SD(X)}\times C + C)\\
\nonumber P^{I} &< \dfrac{(r_c-r_f)}{(1 + r_c)} \times [\dfrac{SD(X_{ret})}{SD(X)}\times C_{X}^{0} - \dfrac{SD(X_{ret})}{SD(X)}\times C + C_{X}^{0} + C_{W}^{0})\\
\nonumber P^{I} &< \dfrac{(r_c-r_f)}{(1 + r_c)} \times C_{X}^{0} + \dfrac{(r_c-r_f)}{(1 + r_c)} \times [\dfrac{SD(X_{ret})}{SD(X)}\times C_{X}^{0} - \dfrac{SD(X_{ret})}{SD(X)}\times C + C_{W}^{0})\\
\nonumber P^{I} &< \dfrac{(r_c-r_f)}{(1 + r_c)} \times C_{X}^{0} + \dfrac{(r_c-r_f)}{(1 + r_c)} \times [\dfrac{SD(X_{ret})}{SD(X)}\times (C - C_{W}^{0}) - \dfrac{SD(X_{ret})}{SD(X)}\times C + C_{W}^{0})\\
\nonumber P^{I} &< \dfrac{(r_c-r_f)}{(1 + r_c)} \times C_{X}^{0} + \dfrac{(r_c-r_f)}{(1 + r_c)} \times [\dfrac{SD(X_{ret})}{SD(X)}\times (-C_{W}^{0})  + C_{W}^{0})\\
P^{I} &< \dfrac{(r_c-r_f)}{(1 + r_c)} \times C_{X}^{0} + \dfrac{(r_c-r_f)}{(1 + r_c)} \times C_{W}^{0} \times (1 - \dfrac{SD(X_{ret})}{SD(X)})\label{final}
\end{align}


The interpretation of equation (\ref{final}) is slightly more difficult than that posed by equation(!). However, we can recognize that first term on the righthand side is a measure of value of capital deployment from equation (!). Then the second terms becomes the value provided by reduction in risk volatility, and we intuitively understand that $(1 - \dfrac{SD(X_{ret})}{SD(X)})$ is a representation of that reduction. Further we its intuitive that the reduced redution in risk would apply to the excess returns on working capital i.e., $((1 + r_c) \times C_{W}^{0})$.
