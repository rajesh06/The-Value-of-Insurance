# Capital Relationships

We now consider the firm's capital. We present the development of the capital structure below:

\begin{eqnarray}
\text{Capital} &= \text{Assets} - \text{Liabilities}
\text{Assets} &= \text{Fixed Assets} - \text{Current Assets}
\end{eqnarray}

\text{Assets} = Capital + Liabilities (Is this correct? I changed "Equity" to "Capital")

Assets = Fixed Assets + Current Assets

Capital = Equity Capital + Debt Capital

Capital = Fixed Assets + Net Working Capital (Current Assets Current Liabilities)

rect(xleft = 0.7, ybottom = 0.3, xright = 1.6, ytop = 0.5)
rect(xleft = 1.6, ybottom = 0.3, xright = 2, ytop = 0.5)
rect(xleft = 0.01, ybottom = 0.6, xright = 0.4, ytop = 0.8)
rect(xleft = 0.3, ybottom = 0.9, xright = 2, ytop = 1.1)

text(x = 1.1, y = 0.1, label = 'C', cex = 1)
text(x = 0.3, y = 0.4, label = 'Fixed Assets', cex = 1)
text(x = 1.1, y = 0.4, label = 'Cw', cex = 1)
text(x = 1.8, y = 0.4, label = 'Res', cex = 1)
text(x = 0.15, y = 0.7, label = 'Cm', cex = 1)
text(x = 1.1, y = 1, label = 'S', cex = 1)

### Can the insurer buyer maintain a lower level of capital?

Under no insurance case, Net Working Capital includes $C_w$ and Reserve set aside for potential claims event.

About S, in the notation description, it seems to represent the largest affordable loss amount, however, in the first formula of 2.1, it represents the amount set aside for potential claims event (which I thought is the reserve)

So I want to use notation $Res$ to represent the Reserve to distinguish them.

I am trying to explain my concept in the following plot.

Back to the question, Insurance can protect losses, revenue is treated as fixed and known quantity, so the companies with insurance would not suffer from any unpredictable loss except the coverage has a upper limit.Therefore, the capital would not decrease to a low level under our assumption.

Insurance can help company release more $C_w$, but can not change other capital requirement.

### 3. How does that volatility of the three situations above affect the return on capital demanded by investors?

To measure the volatility, we can use $var(\Delta C)$ or use the delta ($\frac{d\Delta C}{dX}$). Obviously, under the insurance case, if the only variable is X and coverage has no upper limit, both these 2 measurements would be 0.

To connect the volatility and required return of capital, we can apply the efficient frontier. The efficient frontier is the set of optimal portfolios that offer the highest expected return for a defined level of risk or the lowest risk for a given level of expected return.
