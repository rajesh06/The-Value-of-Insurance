<!-- Here are some ideas to consider. As you think through this, it might take you in additional directions. -->
<!-- That's perfectly fine.  -->

<!-- Can the insurer buyer maintain a lower level of capital? -->

<!-- Consider the various loss cases: -->
<!-- 1) No loss -->
<!-- 2) A loss that allows the firm to continue operations.  -->
<!--   how does the cost of capital increase as you get closer to minimum capital -->
<!--   and what happens if you drop below the minimum capital in terms of the cost to recapitalize -->
<!-- 3) bankruptcy -->
<!-- What happens with capital and return on capital in each of these cases? -->

<!-- How does that volatility of the three situations above affect the return on capital demanded by investors? -->
