Thoughts as they come to me:

The value is a function of quantity (width of layer) and the rate (cost of capital):

I think we want to mention that the cost of capital for the insured would be quite high as the extreme event would threaten the ability of a firm to function as a going concern.

While not within the scope of the paper, its likely that the rate for the insurer is much lower given its ability to diversify risk across insured amd spread risk though the market (so no one insurer is threatended by an extreme event)
