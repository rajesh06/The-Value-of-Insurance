## Title
The Value of High-Excess Commercial Insurance (working title)

## Description
description of the research project and how it might be used by practicing and academic actuaries now or in the future, 

## Literature Review
authors and titles in the literature review  
Most of research in this area focuses on the insurer's return on capital rather than the insured's capital. We identified and reviewed the following papers in our literature review:

[Macalaster, Spencer.  Insurance as a Form of Capital. January 12, 2015](https://www.insurancejournal.com/magazines/mag-closingquote/2015/01/12/353262.htm) described the issue conceptually but without measurement and does not mention the role of teh actuary in establishing reserves.


[Raviv, A. The design of optimal insurance policy. Am. Econ. Rev. 1979, 69, 84–96.](https://www.jstor.org/stable/1802499) uses utility theory to measure value for an insured.

[Gollier, C. Optimal insurance of approximate losses. J. Risk Insur. 1996, 63, 369–380.](https://www.jstor.org/stable/253617) also use utility theory to measure optimize the insured retentions.
