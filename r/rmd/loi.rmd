## Title
The Value of High-Excess Commercial Insurance (working title)

## Description
Firms use property-casualty insurance as a source of "contingent capital." That is, instead of setting aside capital to fund rare events, firms will purchase insurance. 

High layer excess insurance, in particular, serves this purpose. Firms rarely access these layers, and the expected value of claims in those layers is minimal. As such, the insurance policy's primary value is that it allows the firm to deploy the capital that it would otherwise need to set aside to weather an extreme loss event. Our research will focus on the measurement of this value. 

Our research will have a "real-world" context, which recognizes that most large firms use (consulting) actuaries to value reserves. As such, our research will also consider the effect of the process that actuaries use to establish self-insured claim reserves. Specifically, our model will consider that the property-casualty reserving process recognizes claim costs (both retained and insured) gradually. 

We believe that actuaries supporting the evaluation and negotiation commercial insurance contracts will be able to use the results of our research.


## Literature Review
authors and titles in the literature review  
Most of research in this area focuses on the insurer's return on capital rather than the insured's capital. We identified and reviewed the following papers in our literature review:

[Demand of Insurance under the Cost-of-Capital Premium Calculation Principle]


[Macalaster, Spencer.  Insurance as a Form of Capital. January 12, 2015](https://www.insurancejournal.com/magazines/mag-closingquote/2015/01/12/353262.htm) described the issue conceptually but without measurement and does not mention the role of the actuary in establishing reserves.

## Other
* Will provide a practical worked example with our research. We will construct the "data" and actuarial assumptions included in that example.    
* We intend to submit our paper to either North American Actuarial Journal or Variance.

## Author Information
* Rajesh Sahasrabuddhe is a Fellow of the Casualty Actuarial Society, an Associate of the Canadian Institute of Actuaries and a Member of the American Academy of Actuaries. He has been providing actuarial consulting services since 1995 and is an active CAS volunteer. In addition to several papers that appear in the CAS Forum, he has co-authored a paper that appears in Variance. (That paper was selected for the Variance prize.)
